## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Reset (localhost:8080):**
- Check if Flask application is running: `docker exec secureai-local-repo supervisorctl status`
- Install missing Python dependencies: `docker exec secureai-local-repo pip3 install PyYAML networkx`
- Restart Flask service: `docker exec secureai-local-repo supervisorctl restart flask`
- Use Error Diagnosis System: Navigate to `/error-diagnosis/` for intelligent troubleshooting

**Sandbox Creation Issues:**
- **Simplified Mode Fails:** Check filesystem permissions and available disk space
- **Docker Mode Fails:** Ensure Docker-in-Docker is properly configured with `--privileged` flag
- **Container Access:** Check container has access to Docker socket: `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
- **Terraform Issues:** Verify Terraform containers use proper entrypoint override for shell access
- **Performance:** Use Simplified mode for faster sandbox creation (recommended)

**Sandbox Management Issues:**
- **"Remove All" Not Working:** Check Docker daemon status and container permissions
- **Sandbox Not Stopping:** Use "Remove All" button to force cleanup of problematic containers
- **Status Not Updating:** Refresh the page or check container discovery in Docker daemon

**USB Drive Not Detected:**
- Ensure container has `--privileged` flag
- Check volume mounts include `/run/media:/run/media`
- Verify USB drive is mounted on host system

**Git Clone Fails:**
- Check repository exists in `/var/repo/git-repos/`
- Verify Git HTTP backend is running
- Test with: `curl http://localhost:8080/git/repo.git/info/refs`

**Push to Repository Fails:**
- **External Mirrors**: Push operations are blocked by design (read-only)
- **Local Repositories**: Check repository was created via /git-admin/ (not mirrored)
- **Error Message**: "Push to external mirror not allowed" indicates read-only mirror
- **Solution**: Create local repository copy or use original external source

**Mirror Request Fails:**
- **Trust Analysis**: Repository may fail trust/legal thresholds
- **Network Issues**: Check external repository URL accessibility
- **Blocked Country**: Repository hosted in configured blocked countries
- **License Issues**: No approved license detected or export control concerns
- **Solution**: Review analysis details, adjust thresholds, or use admin override

**Repository Modification Blocked:**
- **Branch Creation**: "Cannot create branches in external mirror" - use local repo
- **Repository Deletion**: "Cannot delete external mirror" - use quarantine management
- **File Editing**: External mirror files are read-only - clone to workspace first

**Firefox ESR Issues:**
- JavaScript functionality may be limited
- Use server-side alternatives when available
- Check browser security settings

**Disk Space Full:**
- Clean Docker system: `docker system prune -a -f --volumes`
- Check available space: `df -h`
- Move data to USB drives using data manager

## Git Workflow Examples

**Creating and Using a Local Repository:**
```bash
# 1. Create LOCAL repository via web interface at /git-admin/
# 2. Clone the empty repository (FULL READ/WRITE ACCESS)
git clone http://localhost:8080/git/my-project.git
cd my-project

# 3. Add initial content
echo "# My Project" > README.md
echo "print('Hello World')" > main.py
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master  # ‚úÖ PUSH ALLOWED (local repository)

# 4. Create and work on feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
echo "def new_feature(): pass" >> main.py
git add main.py
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature  # ‚úÖ PUSH ALLOWED

# 5. Switch back to main branch
git checkout master
echo "## Installation" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README"
git push origin master  # ‚úÖ PUSH ALLOWED
```

**Using External Mirror (Read-Only):**
```bash
# 1. Mirror external repository via /mirror-manager/
# 2. Clone the mirrored repository (READ-ONLY ACCESS)
git clone http://localhost:8080/git/external-project.git
cd external-project

# 3. You can read and build, but NOT push
echo "local changes" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Local changes"
git push origin master  # ‚ùå PUSH BLOCKED - "Push to external mirror not allowed"

# 4. To modify external code, create local copy:
git clone http://localhost:8080/git/external-project.git my-fork
cd my-fork
# Create new local repository via /git-admin/ and push there
```

**Secure Mirroring Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Request mirror via web interface at /mirror-manager/
# Enter URL: https://github.com/user/repository.git

# 2. System performs comprehensive analysis:
# - Trust Score: 85/100 (Geographic: US, Contributors: 15, Clean)
# - Legal Score: 90/100 (License: MIT, Redistribution: Allowed)
# - Security: No malware detected, 2 binary files flagged

# 3. Repository approved and mirrored as READ-ONLY
# 4. Clone and use safely:
git clone http://localhost:8080/git/user_repository.git
cd user_repository

# 5. All modification attempts blocked:
git push origin master     # ‚ùå "Push to external mirror not allowed"
# Branch creation via web UI  # ‚ùå "Cannot create branches in external mirror"
# Repository deletion        # ‚ùå "Cannot delete external mirror"
```

**Web-Based Repository Management:**
```bash
# Local Repository Operations (Full Access):
# - Create repositories: /git-admin/ ‚Üí "Create Repository" (read/write)
# - Create branches: /git-admin/ ‚Üí "Branch" button (local repos only)
# - Delete repositories: /git-admin/ ‚Üí "Delete" button (local repos only)
# - Browse repositories: /git-repos/
# - View commits: /git/{repo}/commits
# - Browse files: /git/{repo}/tree

# External Mirror Operations (Read-Only):
# - Mirror repositories: /mirror-manager/ ‚Üí "Analyze & Mirror"
# - View trust analysis: /mirror-manager/ ‚Üí Analysis details
# - Manage quarantine: /mirror-manager/ ‚Üí Quarantined repositories
# - Configure thresholds: /mirror-manager/ ‚Üí Configuration panel
# - Browse mirrors: /git-repos/ (marked as read-only)
```

**Trust Analysis Configuration:**
```bash
# Default Configuration:
# - Trust Threshold: 70/100 (minimum to auto-approve)
# - Legal Threshold: 80/100 (minimum for legal compliance)
# - Blocked Countries: CN, RU, KP, IR
# - Approved Licenses: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause, GPL-3.0, etc.

# Customizable via /mirror-manager/ interface:
# - Adjust trust/legal thresholds
# - Modify blocked country list
# - Update approved license list
# - Force mirror with admin override
```

**Project Template Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Create project from template via web interface at /project-templates/
# 2. Clone the generated project
git clone http://localhost:8080/git/my-flask-app.git
cd my-flask-app

# 3. Set up development environment (example for Flask)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start developing
python app.py

# 5. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new features"
```

**Build Management Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Create or clone a project
git clone http://localhost:8080/git/my-project.git

# 2. Use Build Manager web interface at /build-manager/
# - Project type automatically detected
# - Dependencies listed and status shown
# - One-click operations available

# 3. Install dependencies via web interface
# For Python: python -m venv venv && pip install -r requirements.txt
# For Node.js: npm install
# For C++: mkdir build && cmake .. && make

# 4. Build project via web interface
# Executes appropriate build commands based on project type

# 5. Run tests via web interface
# Executes test commands with real-time output

# All operations provide real-time terminal output and status updates
```
